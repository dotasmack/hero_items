# Script to extract most used items per hero from Dotabuff.com

## General
Dotabuff.com is a great statistics website for Dota.
But there is no statistic showing which items a particular hero purchases the most.
This script retrieves the necessary data from the site and aggregates it in order to answer that question.

## Just gimme the stats
If you're just interested in the stats, then download the file **HeroItems.xslx**.
It was generated in march 2021.
It contains 2 pages:
* raw_data_CSV = Output generated by the script
* HeroItems = Nice table for you to find the information you're interested in

## I'm a geek and I want to run the script
If you're familiar with Python, you can run the script in order to get the newest data.
